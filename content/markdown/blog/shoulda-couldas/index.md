Several years ago, I ended the most prolific and longest lived collaboration of my creative life. Until the mid 2010s, I was part of a group of friends who wrote, performed, and recorded pop songs. It was a band, but I don't feel that we consistently checked off all of those boxes frequently enough to say that's what we were. That being said, we spent thousands of hours together in a recording studio, and the end result is several songs that I count as my greatest artistic achievement to date. And, as these things do, it didn't end well. In addition to the music, this collaboration resulted in several drug-addictions, lots of doubt and frustration, and several sleeve-hearts broken.
## Grow up, there's learning to do.
As the band nerd, a few things fell on my plate naturally. Websites and online distribution were the parts that I hated so as the band broke up, I vindictively stripped it's existence from the internet. This didn't phase me. I had everything that I cared about backed up...somewhere. It's in the cloud, I guess.

And that's how it was, until recently. An old friend and non-musical collaborator sent me a message, stating they were using this crazy time to actually learn to edit video. Did I have any of the old CDs laying around? I have a CD for every release the band made, even the one's I'm not in...after a few false starts with CD ROM drives, I was face to face with a monolith representing my crowning artistic achievement.
