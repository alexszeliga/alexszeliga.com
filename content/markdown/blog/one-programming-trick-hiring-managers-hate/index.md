In the latter half of 2008, I made the decision to leave my job of several years. I wanted out of retail, I wanted to leave customers behind. Dreams of a career in music or entertainment had faded away after I learned how much real work it would take to have a decent shot at a comfortable living. I wasn't desperate then, I was convinced that I'd find a quick-pivot to take me into a warehouse or purchasing or administrative support role in an industry that was connected to my current role. Unfortunately, in November of 2008 something happened that definitely changed the course of my search. The great recession would influence the types of jobs I applied for, and eventually landed me at RevZilla.com in the middle of July 2011.

##### RevZilla.com is made of People
When I joined RevZilla, there were about 20 individuals on the team. What would eventually become a Juggernaut was really still finding it's footing, it's voice, and it's culture. As a person with no college education, I felt blessed and energized by the environment there. There are lines on my resume that have NO business being there, but are in no sense untrue. They only exist because I was able to hang on to an orange rocket ship as it scaled up from a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Delta_Flyer_(2375)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Flyer</a> kinda space-ship ('A twenty fourth century, warp-powered, ultra-responsive hot rod') to more of a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Bistromath" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bistromath</a> type affair, before I eventually bailed out in order to return my life to a rational pace.

### The Refactor
Listen, I'd love to wax rhapsodic about the end of my time at RevZilla. People love hearing about the cracks on the wall inside the Ivory (or Orange) Tower. People love to hear about Steve Jobs' temper and Aerosmith's performance contract rider. Those morbid desires power Glassdoor and Yelp! at the same time. The fact is RevZilla.com was the whirlwind business education that I never knew I wanted. By sitting next to a bunch of very passionate people. I learned things that have become core to my personal philosophy. I learned so much that it is almost a hinderance to my current trajectory, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.

##### Jumping Tracks
I left RevZilla with an offer for a job on the analytics team basically in-hand. On the day that I tendered my notice, my first immediate responsibility was to inform the new Director of Analytics, who was grooming me for the new role. I also had to tell the person who I would have directly reported to, only to find later that I did so on their birthday. I felt I needed to plant my heels and pivot hard. I was done with people and now wanted to wrangle ones and zeros exclusively. I was enrolled in a coding bootcamp that would finish near the end of the year, so I made a plan with my partner to get a part time job and concentrate full time on the bootcamp and getting a job as a developer.

### What's and Wherefore's
I've always cared more about technology than I have about really anything else. When I was a kid, I'd sneak over to my aunt's house to play games like Kings Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, and Wheel of Fortune on her circa-late-eighties computers. When I was a teen, I discovered the 'Net and immediately realized it's potential as a way to chat with girls and get porn. AOL's bevvy of chatroom instances over the years provided a weird shortcut into relationships that would eventually spawn a new type of 'place' a person could be. When I joined RevZilla, I learned that putting a 'mall' next to a chat room was always inevitable. When I left, I was convinced eCommerce would erase brick-and-mortars from our culture, and I still am.

#### A Unique Skillset
I've often said that a job is just 20-30 things that you are willing to do better than anyone else. A career is consistently replacing the five easiest things with five much harder things. For most, not knowing those things is enough to motivate someone to pay you. For many more, knowing exactly how hard those things are is a reason to bid on you. Of course, hubris will inspire people to assume that the easy things never fall away, but I try to be a realist. I couldn't walk into an auto parts store today, and you shouldn't criticize your server because you once waited tables at a Bertucci's. That being said, soft skills I learned as an administrator continue to empower my skills as a collaborator, and skills I've learned in the studio inform how I handle creative problem solving.

#### New Solutions to Old Problems
Oh yeah; the clickbate. Forgot about that. Any time a hiring manager asks you about a "Hello World" function, always tell them there's a bug in the code and that you'll gladly fix it for them. The one thing I've learned, across all my varied and useful experience, is that all context is important. If you can't grok what a customer is going through, you can't help them. If a mechanic doesn't know the name of the part he needs, you have to cross reference the part number. If the guitarist says '...after the chorus I want you to go "diggita-diggita-diggita-chsssss!"' you have to pretend like they are sane. Most context has it's own syntax, and in the case of just about every Hello World example, the one thing missing is a comma.

## "Hello, World."
