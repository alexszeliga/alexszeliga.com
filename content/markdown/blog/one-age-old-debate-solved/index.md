I've been writing [code](https://justinakapaste.com/category/aol-warez/) since I was in my pre-teens. After learning that many of the restrictions of Teen AOL simply didn't exist when you used this thing called "Netscape Navigator", I jumped from writing AOL API integrations with a pirated version of Visual Basic to writing HTML in notepad for GeoCities. After making several websites for myself and others, mostly focused on sharing video game tips, tricks, and cheats, I found myself blown away by this completely new thing: CSS. Around the same time, I remembered seeing game demos using something called Mocha (later, JavaScript). Needless to say, I was a kid witnessing and being influenced by the very early internet.

Then, I gained interest in sex and rock and roll (later, drugs), and basically gave up on programming while I toiled inexorably toward rockstardom (later, an auto parts store). The context here is that I've watched a technology revolution happen in real time.

### PC or Mac?
There are several folks in my life who help keep me focused on keeping my 'shiny side up', in terms of technology and business. My network is great, but there's one thing that even I know not to talk about with them: Windows. I've been lucky to work near to some of the greatest developers in the Philly area, but dang, Apple really has them confused about what we do.

I believe that the work of a developer is mostly creative, so I take a lot of inspiration from my time as a musician. My role in the band was three-fold: I played the drums, I was the engineer in the studio, and I produced the records. To me, the computer was like an amp or a drum set or a microphone. It was a tool in the chain of things that had to go right in order to record a song. Taking that into consideration, it could have been a PC, Mac, or a [portastudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portastudio).

But it was a PC, because of my context...also because I could never afford a Mac.
#### Okay, but 2020 tho?
You're damn right it is. It's 2020 and Apple has [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/) that it's going to use it's own silicon.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is out here, not so quietly [influencing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-github-acquisition-its-all-about-developer-relationships-influence/) real big chunks of web development infrastructure.

But that's just part of it. For the past several years, Microsoft has been slowly but surely building out a set of tools that will become very valuable in the next several years. Specifically, [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-about).

So for those of you keeping score, Apple will spend the next several years throwing lots of resources into transitioning it's existing products to work on a new-ish instruction set, and Windows has Linux built in already. Apple has spent the last several years adding 'features' like the touch bar and a confusing lack of ports, but I think we can safely say that we should expect nothing drastic to change until the transition to Apple Silicon is complete. And does that mean that the Cheesegrater '19 is going to have the same fate as the Trashcan? Several years of being ignored before being replaced by something with a confusingly short lifespan? Who knows.

What I do know is that Microsoft is [scaling back it's retail operations](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/06/26/microsoft-store-announces-new-approach-to-retail/) and focusing on new [weird variants](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/312956-microsoft-may-stream-win32-apps-to-windows-10x-from-the-cloud) of it's core product, Windows 10. Also, Microsoft is not shy about why it's adding Linux to [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs).
